## Budget Tracker Application for Android Devices (Smart Wallet)

The project was developed by the group of 3 Computer Science students for the purpose of personal android application skills development as the part of the Fundamentals of Android Development module.

The project was developed using Java as the main programming language and SQLite as the database for storing the user credentials and data related to the budget.

## Budget Tracker Application for Android Devices (Smart Wallet)
Application contains the functionalities like adjusting the current balance, calculating new balance according to the income and expenses, adding new records, categorizing all of the records, creating custom categories. 

Moreover, the app contains a Currency Exchanger which was developed by using an API for showing the most updated information and easily calculate the amount of money in another currency inside of app.

User can also set the pre-planned payments that in the specified time the payment will be automatically done and update the balance according to the amount of payment. So, the user will not need to create a new record every month for the rent of the house (for example).
